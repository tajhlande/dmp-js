# Digital Math Playground

now with Javascript!

This project is a small experiment to render a 3D Lorenz plot in browser. 
It is an unholy mashup of Three.js and React.  Don't judge me. 

Go see it [here](https://tajhlande.github.io/dmp-js/)!

See the [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) Wikipedia page for more 
information about the dynamic equations that are used to generate this plot. 

Click the "Running" checkbox to get things started. 
Camera controls are Three.js standard... click and drag to rotate the view, right-click
and drag to translate/move the rotation point.
